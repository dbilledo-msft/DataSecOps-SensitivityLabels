# Microsoft Purview Workshop - DataSecOps Data Governance Lifecycle with Security

## What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a family of data governance, risk, and compliance solutions that can help your organization govern, protect, and manage your entire data estate. Microsoft Purview solutions provide integrated coverage and help address the recent increases in remote user connectivity, the fragmentation of data across organizations, and the blurring of traditional IT management roles.

* Gain visibility into data assets across your organization
* Enable access to your data, security, and risk solutions
* Safeguard and manage sensitive data across clouds, apps, and endpoints
* Manage end-to-end data risks and regulatory compliance
* Empower your organization to govern, protect, and manage data in new, comprehensive ways
